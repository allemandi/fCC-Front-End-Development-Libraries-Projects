## Build a Random Quote Machine - Forismatic Quotes
A *random quote generator, with quote sharing functionality via [Twitter's tweeting](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/tweet-button/overview "Tweet button") also implemented. This is built as a CodePen.io app, primarily testing the use of frontend frameworks. This example shows the use of Bootstrap and jQuery for responsive web design and HTML element modification.  

The [random quote machine can be found here.](https://codepen.io/allemandi/full/NWbBVKe "fCC: Random Quote Machine - Forismatic Quotes")

*Credits to [forismatic.com](https://forismatic.com/en/api/) for quotes via API functionality.
