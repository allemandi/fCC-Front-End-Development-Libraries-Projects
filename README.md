Project Challenges for freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries Certification

## Build a Random Quote Machine - Forismatic Quotes
A *random quote generator, with quote sharing functionality via [Twitter's tweeting](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/tweet-button/overview "Tweet button") also implemented.
